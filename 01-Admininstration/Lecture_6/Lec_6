																	1) File System
																	=========
1- What is file system?
	- The way your system organize your data and deals with them on the Hard disk.
	- The directories structure of the main files in the system.
2- meta-data : carries info for the data
	- Like a library

3- Storage Devices : 
	1) Floppy Disk
		- We store "0s and 1s" physically on a magnetic disk, was so small in size.  
	2) Flash Memory
		- Floating Gate MOSFET, applied on it high voltage to write 0 on it, while reading requires less voltage.
	3) Hard Disks
		- Magnetic Disks different from floppy disks ones.
		- Data are scatterd.
	4) CDROMs
		- Laser Engravings.
		
4- Info about data to collect them together to say where they're located?		[collect 0s and 1s on Hard disk]
	- An array of pointers was created that has the address of the data blocks of a specefic file.
	- Each file has it's ID = Inode number.
	- Each Inode number has it's corresponding pointer.
	- Each file has permissions
	- Each file has size
	- Each file has a type
	- Each file has info.
5- This Table is called : 					[Inode Table]
	- It's the meta-data.
6- There's a table "Dentry table"		[To detect which file_name has the inode number]
	- File name
	- Inode number
7- Partitions -> Folders -> Files
8- The hard disk has a group of partitions :
	- 512MB 			-> 		MBR : Master boot record		:	it loads the file system, where there's the partition table that shows each partition starting address & ending address, so it loads the 2nd stage BL.
	- Partitions :
	some data : SUPER BLOCK (meta-data)
		- Partition C
	some data : SUPER BLOCK (meta-data)
		- Partition D
	-Then for each partition it's meta-data.

9- Why do we make partitions?
	1) To organize data (User friendly organization)
	2) Files security & safety.
	3) Each partition can have a different file system.
	
10) FAT file system is an old file system that can handle MAX 4GB (usually used with flasha)
11) File systems for windows NTFS and for Linux EXT4 , Linux can support Windows but tut windows can't support Linux. Carries meta-data.
12) When you mount the partition, the SUPER BLOCK gets loaded into RAM from Hard Disk.
13) Then, every partition with a file system must first be loaded into RAM to be able to deal with it as a files & directories.
14) What is the difference between different file systems ?
	- Size variable in inode table, what is it's type? unsigned char , can hold to MAX size = 255 block only.
	- What if a block with size > 255 ?  
15) Used space in a formatted flasha, is the size of the SUPER BLOCK meta-data.
	- Used space = 16384 Bytes.		=>		2**14.
16) Windows has file systems trees for each storage device while Linux has only 1 file system regarding how many storage devices.
17) What vaires between a file systems is the size of data blocks saved in sequence, what is it's size?
	1- If the block size was big, we'd use alot of pointers (large array of pointers) that will use large meta-data, then theres more waste in meta-data storage (like what happend at the flasha) that will cause => Internal Fragmentation = if block size = 4MB, and our pic is only 1MB, then there is a waste of bytes (3MB) those are internal fragmentation.
	Then, Internal Fragmentation : It's the wasted space not used due to the large size of block.
	It also has less number of read requests.
	When data loss, repeat the transition of the whole big block.
	Slower block transmission.
	2- If the block size was small, has so small internal fragmentation.
	Has more number of reading requests.
	When data loss, repeat the transition of a small block.
	Faster block transmission.
	EX: Like a bowl of fish, we want to transfer it from a room to another.
	----
18) Dentry table is presented at each directory.
19) Linux VFS (Virtual file system) :
	1- Detects the needed File system to perform the operation.
	2- Load this File system into the RAM if not loaded already
	3- Performs the operation.
20) lsblk 		=> shows all paritions in system.
21) Partitions :
	1- Data Partition
	2- Swap Partition : Tells the OS when the RAM is full to load data into this swap partition [un-needed data]
		To avoid Linux crashing due the full RAM, we create this swap partition, it carries the programs running in background while you're using other programs, and when you use them [alt+tab] they're loaded into RAM and the other program is moved  to the swapped partition. [extension like RAM but slower]
22) sudo fdisk + partition_name
23) sudo blockdev --getbsz /dev/sda				[ To get the block size ]			=> 4096B = 4KB
24) ls -li													[ i: iNode nuber ]
25) To show the internal fragmentation 
26) when Inode number range is full , then it's full.
27) df -h													[df -ih : to view Inodes too]
28) stat file_name
